Java code examples used live in class to demonstrate key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and UML. Meant for learning and experimentation, not full projects. Repository is a reference for in-class demonstrations.

Topics:
Classes & Objects

1. Defining classes and objects  
2. Instance variables and methods  
3. Constructors (default, overloaded) 
4. Constructor chaining (this()) 
5. The this keyword  
6. Accessing objects and fields (. operator or access modifier)  
7. UML basics (class diagrams)
8. Class abstraction and encapsulation  
9. Static variables and methods
10. Constants (static final)
11. Visibility modifiers  public `+` protected `#` package `~`  private `-`
12. Getter and setter methods  
13. Arrays of objects  
14. Immutable objects 
15. The toString() and equals() method

Inheritance

16. Superclass and Subclass
17. The `extends` Keyword
18. Inheritance of Fields and Methods
19. Constructor Chaining (`super()`)
20. The `super` Keyword (super. in method)
21. Method Overriding
22. Abstract Methods 
23. Object Casting (Upcasting, Downcasting)
    
---

Polymorphism

24. Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)
25. The `instanceof` Operator (more example..)
    
---

Interfaces & Abstract Classes

26. Interfaces (`interface`, `implements`)
27. Abstract Classes in Depth
28. Multiple Inheritance of Type (Interfaces)
29. Implementing Multiple Interfaces
30. The `Comparable<T>` Interface (`compareTo`)
31. The `Cloneable` Interface (`clone`)
Note: Show the array of comparable objects even if they are not 
the same class of objects, like edible.

Generics

32. Motivation for Generics (Type Safety, Eliminating Casting)
33. Generic Classes (`GenericClass<T>`)
34. Bounded Type Parameters (`<T extends Number>`)
35. Multiple Bounds (`<T extends A & B>`)
36. Generic Methods (`<T> T methodName(...)`)
37. Raw Types (and Why to Avoid Them)
38. Wildcards – Unbounded (`<?>`)
39. Wildcards – Upper Bounded (`<? extends T>`)
40. Wildcards – Lower Bounded (`<? super T>`)
41. Generic Collections (`ArrayList<T>`, `HashMap<K,V>`)
42. Restrictions and Limitations of Generics
